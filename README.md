# QuOp_MPI

## Introduction

QuOp_MPI is a Python 3 module for parallel distributed memory simulation of Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithms on arbitrary mixing graphs. See https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.08227 and https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.07353 for the theoretical background.

QuOp_MPI's complete documentation is hosted at https://quop-mpi.readthedocs.io.

## General Dependencies

+ An MPI implementation configured with --enabled-shared.
+ FFTW configured with --enable-fortran, --enable-mpi and --enable-shared.
+ HDF5 configured with --enable-fortran, --enable-parallel, and --enable-shared.

src/Makefile assumes that the include and lib directories containing the FTW and HDf5 shared object libraries are located in /usr/local, this file may need to be modified for your system.

## Python Dependencies

+ numpy
+ scipy
+ h5py
+ Networkx (To run included example programs.)

## Running and Installing QuOp_MPI on Clusters

Please consult the section covering containerisation in the QuOp_MPI docs.

## Installation on Unix-Like Systems

If the general and python dependencies are satisfied, QuOp_MPI can be installed by downloading or cloning the program from https://github.com/Edric-Matwiejew/QuOp_MPI. Then:

    cd QuOp_MPI/src
    make
    cd ../
    python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
    pip3 install qsw_mpi-0.0.1.tar.gz

Before importing QuOp_MPI in a python script, ensure that the path to the FFTW and HDF5 libraries is present in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable. If they are not present:

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:<path to HDF5 lib>:<path to FFTW lib>

## Documentation
To generate a local copy of the documentation, if not already present, install sphinx, sphinx-rtd-theme and m2r. On systems using pip:

    pip3 install sphinx sphinx-rtd-theme m2r

Navigate to QuOp_MPI/docs and build the documentation:

    make html

Documentaion will then be present in QuOp_MPI/docs/build/html.

## Detailed installation on Windows

QuOp_MPI has been developed for Unix-like systems. While, in principle, it is perfectly possible to install QuOp_MPI on a Windows system, this is not currently supported. If you wish to run QuOp_MPI on Windows 10 it is advised that the user install the Linux Subsystem for windows, choose Ubuntu as the installed Linux distribution and proceed with the installation method detailed below.

## Detailed installation on Ubuntu 18.04.4

The following processes successfully installed QuOP_MPI on Ubuntu 18.04.4, this as not been tested on other Linux distros,, but the processes should generally be applicable with minor modifications.

Install MPICH and build applications:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install build-essential cython python3-dev python3-pip python3-setuptools wget git mpich

FFTW and HDF5, as provided by the Ubuntu app repository, have not been built with the required options. These must be built from source.

    wget https://support.hdfgroup.org/ftp/HDF5/releases/hdf5-1.10/hdf5-1.10.6/src/hdf5-1.10.6.tar.gz
    tar -xvf hdf5-1.10.6.tar.gz
    cd hdf5-1.10.6
    ./configure --enable-fortran --enable-shared --enable-parallel --prefix=/usr/local
    make && make install
    cd

    wget http://www.fftw.org/fftw-3.3.8.tar.gz
    tar -xvf fftw-3.3.8.tar.gz
    cd fftw-3.3.8
    ./configure --enable-mpi --enable-fortran --enable-shared --prefix=/usr/local
    make && make install
    cd

Install the python dependencies:

    pip3 install wheel h5py mpi4py numpy networkx scipy

Clone, build and install QuOp_MPI:

    git clone https://github.com/Edric-Matwiejew/QuOP_mpi
    cd QuOp_MPI/src
    make
    cd ../
    python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
    cd dist
    pip3 install quop_mpi*.tar.gz
    cd

Alternatively:

    git clone https://github.com/Edric-Matwiejew/QuOP_mpi
    cd QuOp_MPI/src
    make
    cd ../
    python3 setup.py develop

Will install QuOp_MPI with reference to the QuOp_MPI source folder. This is useful if you wish to debug or modify the package.

Finally, check for successful installation by:

    mpiexec -N 2 python3 -m quop_mpi

## Detailed Installation on MacOS X

The following installation method uses the 'Homebrew' package manager. This can be installed via the following terminal command:

    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"

You will be prompted for your user password on installing the homebrew dependencies and on installing homebrew itself.

Next, install the GNU compiler collection, python3 + pip3, MPI, and utilities required to download and configure QuOp_MPI's dependencies.

    brew install gcc python wget pkg-config mpich

Download, extract and install parallel-HDF5.

    wget https://support.hdfgroup.org/ftp/HDF5/releases/hdf5-1.10/hdf5-1.10.6/src/hdf5-1.10.6.tar.gz
    tar -xvf hdf5-1.10.6.tar.gz
    cd hdf5-1.10.6
    export CC=mpicc
    export FC=mpif90
    ./configure --enable-fortran --enable-shared --enable-parallel --prefix=/usr/local
    make
    sudo make install
    cd

Download, extract and install FFTW.

    wget http://www.fftw.org/fftw-3.3.8.tar.gz
    tar -xvf fftw-3.3.8.tar.gz
    cd fftw-3.3.8
    ./configure --enable-mpi --enable-fortran --enable-shared --prefix=/usr/local
    make
    sudo make install
    cd

Finally, we can clone and install QuOp_mpi.

    git clone https://github.com/Edric-Matwiejew/QuOP_mpi
    cd QuOp_mpi/src
    make
    (Note: entered into makefile and altered LIB and INCLUDE to go to /usr/local/libor /usr/local/include. I think is can be done in the terminal however)
    cd ../
    python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
    cd dist
    pip3 install quop_mpi*.tar.gz
    cd

Alternatively:

    git clone https://github.com/Edric-Matwiejew/QuOP_mpi
    cd QuOp_mpi/src
    make
    cd ../
    python3 setup.py develop

Will install QuOp_MPI with reference to the QuOp_MPI source folder. This is useful if you wish to debug or modify the package.

Finally, check for successful installation by:

    mpiexec -N 2 python3 -m quop_mpi


Finally, check for successful installation by:

    mpiexec -N 2 python3 -m quop_mpi
